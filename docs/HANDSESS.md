## Status Highlights

* The Payment Initiation flow at HANDSESS requires that you call either "Payment initiation status request" or "Get Payment Initiation authorization Sub-Resources Request" endpoint to finalize the payment after authorizing it with Mobilt BankID. This must be done within the lifetime of the access token generated by Mobilt BankID, this lifetime is not documented by ASPSP but is short.

* HTTP header PSU-ID is required by the ASPSP in the form `yyyyMMddNNNN` when calling "Start the authorization process.." or "Update PSU Data.." both for Payment and Consent.

* HTTP header PSU-IP-Address is required by the ASPSP for all endpoints.

* "Read Transaction Details" not supported by ASPSP.


## Supported SCA Methods
|Environment     |Supported SCA Method     | Authentication Method | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
|Sandbox         |Decoupled      | None   | Authentication is automatically approved and finalized by ASPSP directly when calling "Start the authorization process.." endpoint.|
|Production      |Decoupled      | Mobilt BankID | - PSU must start the Mobilt BankID app with returned autostarttoken within 30 sec. from when "Start the authorization process.." service was called or SCA will fail.<br>- To properly initiate the Mobilt BankID app, the TPP must construct a link with the the format: `bankid:///?autostarttoken={AUTO_START_TOKEN}&redirect={ANY_REDIRECT_URI}`. The redirect query is mandatory for iOS and optional for Android. The TPP must then tell the PSU to open this link on its mobile or generate a QR code for it and ask the PSU to scan it with the Mobilt BankID app. |
