## Berlin Group NextGen specification
The first generation of Open Payments API is based on the [Berlin Groups NextGen specification](https://www.berlin-group.org/psd2-access-to-bank-accounts), developed to create uniform and interoperable integration between banks and TPPs.

## PSD2
With PSD2, the European Union has published a new directive for payment services in the EC internal market. All EC member states have to adopt to this directive by national laws.
PSD2 contains regulations of the AIS, PIS and Confirmation of the Availability of Funds services. This means that financial institutes, if their customers consent, must leave out information to Third Party Providers (TPPs) that may be forwarded to other TPPs within the PSD2 regulation scope.

## XS2A Interface Specification
The XS2A Interface is designed as a B2B interface between a TPP server and the ASPSP server to comply with PSD2.
