## Standards
The first generation of Open Payments API is based on the [Berlin Groups NextGen specification](https://www.berlin-group.org/psd2-access-to-bank-accounts) which was developed to create uniform and interoperable integration between banks and TPPs.

## The APIs
The APIs in this product does not interface directly with the banks but provide information to be able to access banks dynamically. We will add banks continuously and if you get the list of banks from this API you will get access to these new banks automatically without the need to do any coding. 

## Documentation
This documentation aims to give an understanding of the Open Payment platform and how to use the API services.
The used terminology is collected in the [Glossary](glossary.md).
