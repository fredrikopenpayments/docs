# Getting started with Payment Initiation Services (PIS)

This API is used to get consent for and initiating payments. Note that the consent from the consent API is only used to access the account information API and that this API has its own consent procedure. (Very similar to the one in the consent API.)

Available `AUTH_HOST` values
- https://auth.sandbox.openbankingplatform.com
- https://auth.openbankingplatform.com

Available `API_HOST` values
- https://api.sandbox.openbankingplatform.com

## Introduction

This documentation describes the payment flow.

## Acquire an access token for Payment Initiation

Get a token to use for subsequent calls to the API. The scope should be set to `paymentinitiation`.

    curl -X POST
		[AUTH_HOST]/connect/token
		-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
		-d 'client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]&scope=paymentinitiation&grant_type=client_credentials'

This post will return a JSON object that looks like this:

    {
        "access_token": "[ACCESS_TOKEN]",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "token_type": "Bearer"
    }

## Payment initiation request

    curl -X POST
        [API_HOST]/psd2/paymentinitiation/v1/payments/[PAYMENT_PRODUCT]
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]'
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
        -H 'PSU-IP-Address: [PSU_IP_ADDRESS]'
        -H 'X-BicFi: [BICFI]'
        -H 'X-Request-ID: [GUID]'
        -d '{
			"instructedAmount":
			{
				"currency": "SEK",
				"amount": "142.66"
			},
			"debtorAccount":
			{
				"iban": "[DEBTOR_IBAN]",
				"currency": "SEK"
			},
			"creditorName": "Enterprise Inc",
			"creditorAccount":
			{
				"iban": "[CREDITOR_IBAN]",
				"currency": "SEK"
			},
			"remittanceInformationUnstructured": "[MESSAGE]"
        }'

### Headers

- `PSU-IP-Address` is the IP address of the end user.
- `X-BicFi` the BICFI for the user's ASPSP. Find it in [the ASPSP API](/docs/tutorials/aspsp#get-aspsps-for-a-countries-andor-cities).
- `X-Request-ID` used to verify that the response matches the request.

### Path parameters

`PAYMENT_PRODUCT` can be one of:

- `domestic` - this is a non-euro payment within one country.
- `sepa-credit-transfers` - this is a EURO payment from one EURO ASPSP to another
- `international` - this is an international payment

The [ASPSP details endpoint](/docs/tutorials/aspsp#get-aspsp) will tell you what payment products that are availalbe for that ASPSP.

	}

### Response headers

- `X-Request-ID`
- `ASPSP-SCA-Approach` see below for different values.

### Test procedure

If the ASPSP uses OAuth:
- The above endpoint returns an OAuth authorize URL in the `scoOAuth` field. 
- Replace all the bracketed fields with real values. In your code you will have to replace only the two TPP values.
    - `TPP_REDIRECT_URI` should be the URL to redirect to after auth is completed.
    - `TPP_STATE` can be anything the TPP wants.
    - `BICIFI`
- Run it in a browser. In this case you will get to a page at the ESSESESS sandbox. It may differ for different banks.
- In the page you get to you can use one of the following fake personal numbers:
    - 9311219639
    - 9311219589
    - 8811215477
    - 8811212862
    - 8311211356
- When you submit the data you will be redirected to the `[TPP_REDIRECT_URI]`
- On this URI a `code` param will be added. 
- Use this `code` in the subsequent call when getting the account information token.

Call the OAuth token endpoint to finalize payment.

    curl -X POST
        [AUTH_HOST]/connect/token
        -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        -H 'X-PaymentAuthorisationId: [PAYMENT_AUTH_ID]'
        -H 'X-PaymentId: [PAYMENT_ID]'
        -d 'client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]&code=[CODE]&redirect_uri=[TPP_REDIRECT_URI]&grant_type=authorization_code'
